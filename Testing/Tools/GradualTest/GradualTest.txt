GradualTest ver. 2.4

All the test utilities for chess engines that is in my knowledge is
primary designed for tactical tests (only one best move).
My need was to have a test utility that could be running on test position
where there could be many good moves and maybe one best move, just like you
see in some test books. 

So this utility is what it results in. 

Syntax:
GradualTest [switches] <engine command>

** switches:

  /c - Command to reset hash. Defaults to 'new'. 
  /e - Method to set up the board. Values: edit, cbedit or setboard.
       Default=setboard. (cbedit is used if the engine have implemented
       Chessbase's method of edit.)
  /i - Input file to be tested.
  /o - Output file.
  /s - Init string for the engine. Defaults to 'xboard\nnew\nlevel 1 1440 0\npost\n'.
  /t - Time to use at each position.
  /w - File to write positions with move not found.
  /g - File to write positions with only good moves

Each position that is tested would be saved in an output file.
If you run the same test again, with the same output file, then only
tests that not already is in the outputfile will be tested.

If you only want to see results then you could use the /o switch alone
and no testing would be done.

If there is any spaces in the switch values you should surround it ".
eg. /s "xboard\nst 86000\nnew".
The engine command will not need this if not the engine itself need it.
eg. c:\Program files\crafty\wcrafty log is legal.

Ex.

GradualTest /i wac.epd /o crafty_wac_10.epd /t 10 wcrafty.exe

This would let crafty run through the position in wac.epd.

If you abort (ctrl C) the test after 25 position. You could
see the result with the command:

GradualTest /o crafty_wac_10.epd

If you would let Crafty proceed with the test, the command is
exactly like the first time:

GradualTest /i wac.epd /o crafty_wac_10.epd /t 10 wcrafty.exe

If you let it run to finish the test it will print out the scoretable.

For seeing the scoretable later run GradualTest again but now only
with the /o switch:

GradualTest /o crafty_wac_10.epd


The commands that are sent to the engine are:

After startup Gradual test send:

xboard
new
level 1 1440 0
post

This commands could be changed through the /s switch. Be sure to set the level
(or 'st n' if this is better) so it don't make any move before the test time
is over.

Before each position GradualTest send:

new
setboard <fen string>
time 8640000
otim 8640000
go

The first 'new' command is for clearing the hash and could be
changed through the /c switch.

The setboard command set up the board. If your engine use the old
Winboard method (edit) you could add '/e edit' to the command line.
Also the Chessbase extension to edit is supported, you then will use
'/e cbedit' instead of '/e edit'. The default /e switch is '/e setboard'
so if your engine support this you don't need to use this switch.

To force the move it will send the move now (?) command at the time
when the testtime is over.

The essential command that the engine must support is 'setboard' (or 'edit'),
'go' and '?'.

The engine is running in its home directory so if it needs any ini files
you should put it in there.

** Input fileformat.

This could be an ordinary epd file or a somewhere modified one.

The modification is to let the test be performed when avoid/best-move
have other scores than -1/1.

Ex.

In this test by Pandolfini:

r1b1k2r/3nbppp/p1qpp3/1p4P1/4PP2/P1NBBQ2/1PP4P/R3K2R b KQkq -
am a5 d5; bm Rb8 Bb7 Nb6 Nc5 e5 O-O h6; id "G1Q2";

he have given the following score.

Bad moves:
a5 -1
d5 -1

Good moves
Rb8 5
Bb7 2
Nb6 2
Nc5 3
e5  1
O-O 2
h6  2

To construct the c1 field we line up all scores after each other as it
appears in the am and bm field with am field sorted before bm field.
It must be a whitespace between each score.
Then we will get from
am: -1 -1
bm: 5 2 2 3 1 2 2

Putting in the c1 field would look like:
c1 "-1 -1 5 2 2 3 1 2 2";

The hole epd line could then be something like this:

r1b1k2r/3nbppp/p1qpp3/1p4P1/4PP2/P1NBBQ2/1PP4P/R3K2R b KQkq -
am a5 d5; bm Rb8 Bb7 Nb6 Nc5 e5 O-O h6; 
c0 "Iordachescu-Portisch"; c1 "-1 -1 5 2 2 3 1 2 2"; id "G1Q2";

I have added Tony Hedlund's positional test (with his permission, thanks!).
See his site for some testresults and comments:
http://home.interact.se/~w100107/fentest.htm

Other places to find tests could be in some of these positional test-books
meant for human test. Also the 'Match the Masters' test in Chessmaster
is easy to translate (and nice to use).

** Output fileformat.

The output format of the '/o' file is the same epd file as the inputfile with added the
following epd opcodes:

acd - Depth of the search for the pv line.
acn - Number of node serched for the pv line.
acs - Seconds searched for the pv line.
ce  - Centipawn evaluation of the pv line.
pm  - The best move from the engine.
pv  - The last pv line (pv=Predicted Variation).

Ex:
r1b1k2r/3nbppp/p1qpp3/1p4P1/4PP2/P1NBBQ2/1PP4P/R3K2R b KQkq - 
acd 7; acn 4627749; acs 4040; am a5 d5; bm Rb8 Bb7 Nb6 Nc5 e5 O-O h6; 
c0 "Iordachescu-Portisch, Linares 2000"; c1 "-1 -1 5 2 2 3 1 2 2"; 
ce -26; id "G1Q2"; pm Bb7; pv Bb7 O-O-O Rc8 Rhe1;

The files generated with /w and /g switches are cleaned.

                  -Highlight right answer.

                   of number for the first 4 field.
                  -Sleep in 2 sec. before first position is tested
16.Jan.02  2.3    -Fixed bug that was introduced in 2.2 :)
 3.Feb.02  2.4    -Bug fix: Error when reading commentfield.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Known bugs:
none.

Tested engines:
Anmon 5.10    (use /e edit)
Bringer 1.8   (use /e edit)
Comet B37
Crafty 18.10
Gerbil 1.1
LG2000 3.0    (use /e edit)
SOS 11/99     (use /e edit)
TheKing 3.12d (use /s to modify the initstring)
Yace 0.99 50  (add 'GUI CP' to the ini file or in the '/s' switch to get a pv string.)

I have not tested the '/e cbedit' so it could be that this is better for the engines that
need '/e edit'.
