AdjustEval ver. 1.2

This is an utility to find personalities for engines.

Syntax:
AdjustEval [switches] <engine command>

** switches:

  /a - Commandfile for setup
  /c - Command to reset hash. Defaults to 'new'. 
  /d - Max depth for each position. Default=2.
  /e - Method to set up the board. Values: edit, cbedit or setboard.
       Default=setboard. (cbedit is used if the engine have implemented
       Chessbase's method of edit.)
  /i - Input file to be tested.
  /o - Output file with settings.
  /m - Max setings in output file (def=100).
  /s - Init string for the engine. Defaults to 'xboard\nnew\nlevel 1 1440 0\n'.
  /t - Time to use at each position.

If there is any spaces in the switch values you should surround it ".
eg. /s "xboard\nst 86000\nnew".
The engine command will not need this if not the engine itself need it.
eg. c:\Program files\crafty\wcrafty log is legal.

Ex.

AdjustEval /i gmpos.epd /o result.txt /t 10 /d 2 wcrafty.exe

This would let crafty run through the position in gmpos.epd.

The commands that are sent to the engine are:

After startup AdjustEval send:

xboard
new
level 1 1440 0

This commands could be changed through the /s switch. Be sure to set the level
(or 'st n' if this is better) so it don't make any move before the test time
is over.

Before each position AdjustEval send:

new
< setup commands >
setboard <fen string>
time 8640000
otim 8640000
sd n
go

The first 'new' command is for clearing the hash and could be
changed through the /c switch.

< setup commands > is setting up the engine with the command found in the command file

The setboard command set up the board. If your engine use the old
Winboard method (edit) you could add '/e edit' to the command line.
Also the Chessbase extension to edit is supported, you then will use
'/e cbedit' instead of '/e edit'. The default /e switch is '/e setboard'
so if your engine support this you don't need to use this switch.

To force the move it will send the move now (?) command at the time
when the testtime is over.

The essential command that the engine must support is 'setboard' (or 'edit'),
'go' and '?'.

The engine is running in its home directory so if it needs any ini files
you should put it in there.

** Input fileformats.

EPD file with test positions.

Commandfile to alter the evaluation terms.

Command|Min value|Max value|Step

  Command:
    The command for changing the evaluation term.

  Min value:
    Start value for this evaluation.

  Max value:
    End value for this evaluation.

  Step:
    The change in value between each try.

  Ex.

  Testing eval for bad bishop and bishop pair

  set badbishop|0|70|1
  set bishoppair|0|50|1

  When the test is run it will alterate through all possible values

  -----------------
  set badbishop 0
  set bishoppair 0
  -----------------
  set badbishop 1
  set bishoppair 0
  -----------------
         //
  -----------------
  set badbishop 70
  set bishoppair 49
  -----------------
  set badbishop 70
  set bishoppair 50
  -----------------

  and then save the score for each test to a file sorted by best score.
