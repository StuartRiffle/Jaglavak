ICSDRONENG(6)                                                    ICSDRONENG(6)



NAME
       icsdroneng -  Interface between an xboard chess engine and an ICS

SYNOPSIS
       icsdrone [options]

DESCRIPTION
       icsdroneng acts as an interface between an ICS (Internet Chess Server)
       and a chess engine supporting the XBoard/WinBoard protocol. Unlike
       XBoard/WinBoard it does not use a graphical interface so it is suitable
       for use on embedded systems.

       UCI engines may be used through the polyglot adapter.

       icsdroneng started its life a fork of icsdrone by Henrik Gram.  It was
       originally developed for FICS (the Free Internet Chess Server) but
       currently ICC (the Internet Chess Club) works as well.

       icsdroneng has the following new features.

           - Feedback on commands.
           - Builtin polyglot book support.
           - Feedback on the current evaluation and principal variation
             (through "whisper" or "kibitz" or the "proxyFeedback" option).
           - "Daemon mode" (run in background).
           - PGN logging.
           - Auto reconnection in case of network problems.
           - Support for resigning on behalf of the engine.
           - Support for handling of draw offers.
           - Support for autojoining tourneys.
           - Builtin support for using timeseal.
           - Optional "shortlog". E.g. for consulting via a webbrowser.
           - Interactive console with readline support and colors.
           - An ICS proxy.

       When instructed via the "proxy" option, icsdroneng act as a proxy for
       the ICS it is connected to. This is similar to using xboard with zippy
       but now the "GUI" (xboard/winboard) can be closed without terminating
       the engine.

OPTIONS
       All options take an argument. In the case of boolean options this is
       on/off.

       -icsHost (default: "freechess.org")
           Hostname of the ICS server.

       -icsPort (default: 23)
           Port of the ICS server.

       -timeseal
           Path to timeseal binary.

       -handle (default: "guest")
           Login handle.

       -password (default: "xxx")
           ICS password

       -loginScript
           Script with login data and commands.

       -owner
           Specifies a ICS handle of a user which can send tell commands to
           icsdroneng.

       -autoReconnect (default: "on")
           Autoreconnect to ICS on network failures.

       -console (default: "on")
           Start up with console enabled. The console looks somewhat nicer
           when readline support is compiled in.

       -daemonize (default: "off")
           Go into background. This implies console off.

       -feedback (default: "off")
           Send info about the eval and principal variation.

       -feedbackOnlyFinal (default: "on")
           Give feedback info only before move.

       -feedbackCommand (default "whisper")
           The command to use to send feedback to observers. Use "kibitz" if
           you want your opponent to also see the feedback.

       -proxyFeedback (default: "off")
           Make icsdroneng give PV feedback directly to the proxy (i.e.
           without relying on kibitz/whisper).

       -ownerQuiet (default: "off")
           Send no tells to the owner about starting and finishing games.

       -engineQuiet (default: "off")
           Do no pass on most engine commands to the ICS. Some engines are
           just too noisy.

       -program (default: "gnuchess")
           Command to start the engine. If the engine is an UCI engine then
           this should be an appropriate polyglot command.

       -nice
           Run the engine at lower priority.

       -searchDepth (default: 0)
           Specifies the maximum search depth for the engine. 0 means
           unlimited.

       -secPerMove (default: 0)
           Specifies the maximum time to search for the engine. 0 means
           unlimited.

       -easyMode (default: "on")
           Specifies if the engine thinks on the opponents time or not.

       -resign (default: "on")
           Specifies if icsdroneng will resign on behalf of the engine.

       -acceptDraw (default: "on")
           Specifies if icsdroneng will accept draw offers on behalf of the
           engine.

       -scoreForWhite  (default: "off")
           Specifies if the engine reports the score of white (like Crafty).
           If the engine is Crafty then icsdroneng will turn this on
           automatically.  This is important to handle resigns and draw offers
           correctly.

       -dontReuseEngine (default: "on")
           If true then icsdroneng will restart the engine after each game.

       -book
           Path to an opening book in polyglot format.

       -logFile (default: "<handle>.log")
           Path to the logfile. If the name ends in .gz and zlib support is
           compiled in then the logfile will be compressed.

       -logAppend (default: "off")
           Specifies if we should append to the logfile.

       -logging (default: "on")
           Specifies if logging is enabled. Note that logfiles are very large
           so on an embedded system you probably want to disable this.

       -pgnFile (default: "<handle>.pgn")
           Log games to this file.

           Optionally redirect the game through a shell command by beginning
           the file name with a '|'-character (pipe).  For example: -pgnFile
           "|process-game.py Data/games.db"

       -pgnLogging (default: "on")
           Specifies if logging of games is enabled.

       -shortLogFile (default: "<handle>.txt")
           Log start/end of games as well as received tells to this file.

       -shortLogging (default: "on")
           Specifies if short logging is enabled.

       -sendLogin
           Commands to send at login. Multiple commands can be separated by
           \n.

       -sendGameStart (default: "say this is <enginename>")
           Commands to send at start of game. Multiple commands can be
           separated by \n.

       -sendGameEnd
           Commands to send at end of game. Multiple commands can be separated
           by \n.

       -sendTimeout (default: "resume")
           Commands to send when idle. Multiple commands can be separated by
           \n.

       -limitRematches  (default: 0)
           After this number of rematches wait 60 seconds before accepting. 0
           means disable.

       -hardLimit (default: 0)
           After this number of rematches automatically decline the next match
           offer from the same opponent. 0 means disable.

       -issueRematch (default: "off")
           Send "rematch" at end of the game.

       -acceptOnly
           Accept only challenges from this user.

       -noplay
           Comma separated list of players to auto decline offers from (case
           sensitive). Note this is not the same as the ICS "noplay" list.

       -autoJoin (default: "on")
           Autojoin tourneys. Currently this does not work on ICC.

       -proxy (default: "off")
           Proxy the ICS.

       -proxyPort (default: 5000)
           The port to listen on.

       -proxyHost (default: "127.0.0.1")
           The interface to listen on. This must be the numeric ip address of
           the interface. The default ensures that only connections from
           localhost are possible.  To allow connections from anywhere use
           "0.0.0.0".  This is only recommended if you are behind a firewall
           as icsdroneng is not designed for security.  Note that even if you
           are only listening locally there are still a number of options to
           connect remotely such as the xboard "gateway" option or ssh
           tunneling.

       -proxyLogin (default "off")
           If this is true, icsdroneng will display a login prompt on the
           proxy. User/password are derived from the -handle and -password
           arguments and from the strings entered at the icsdrone login
           prompt.

       -variants (default is server specific)
           This is a string of comma separated variant specifiers.  The
           default for a generic ics is

           "lightning,blitz,standard,wild/1=wildcastle,wild/2, \
                 wild/3,wild/4,wild/5"

           This means that almost all ics variants translate to the chess
           variant "normal" except "wild/1" which translates to "wildcastle".

       -colorTell
       -colorAlert
       -colorDefault
           Some colors for use in the console when icsdroneng is compiled with
           readline support.

CONSOLE, PROXY AND TELL COMMANDS, SCRIPTS
       While icsdroneng is running you can send commands to it via the console
       or via the proxy and if you are the owner also via "tell". In addition
       commands can be put in scripts which can be loaded or specified as a
       login script (with the command line option "-loginScript").

       If you use a login script the first two lines should be the username
       and password.

       The following commands are interpreted by icsdroneng.

           help       Give some rudimentary help
           set        Set an option (see below)
           softquit   Quit at the end of this game
           hardquit   Quit now
           restart    Quit and reconnect if autoReconnect is enabled. Otherwise quit.
           options    List the settable options
           coptions   List all options including those not settable at runtime.
           daemonize  Go into background
           load       Execute a script (for security reasons the name should end with .icsdrone)

       Other commands (e.g. "draw", "seek", "match") will be forwarded to the
       ICS.  Unless they are prefixed by * in which case they will be sent to
       the engine.

       With the "set" command you can change some command line options at
       runtime.  This applies to the following options.

           easymode
           searchdepth
           secpermove
           sendgameend
           sendgamestart
           sendtimeout
           sendlogin
           limitrematches
           issuerematch
           hardlimit
           acceptonly
           feedback
           feedbackonlyfinal
           feedbackcommand
           proxyfeedback
           ownerquiet
           pgnlogging
           shortlogging
           noplay
           autojoin
           autoreconnect
           resign
           acceptdraw
           scoreforwhite
           colortell
           coloralert
           colordefault

       In contrast to command line options, these options are not case
       sensitive.

ADITIONAL REMARKS
       It is important to always issue manual seeks. E.g. seek 1 0 m.  In that
       way icsdroneng can perform checks before accepting an opponent (like
       verifying the noplay option). This is especially important when playing
       as a guest on FICS since in that case FICS does not know you are a
       computer and will auto match seeks (annoying the hell out of people who
       do not expect to get a computer opponent).  icsdroneng defends against
       this but this will only work if you issue manual seeks.

EXAMPLES
       An example command line

           icsdrone -owner RoboOwner -program "polyglot engine.ini"  -loginScript engine.script -timeseal ./timeseal.Linux -book performance.bin -daemonize on -proxy on

       Here is an example login script

           RoboUser
           xxxx
           set sendgameend say thanks\nseek 2 12 m
           seek 2 12 m

       A command line to make crafty play blitz without further intervention

          icsdrone -handle RoboUser -password xxx -program crafty -sendLogin "seek 2 12 m" -sendGameEnd "seek 2 12 m" -proxy on

       an equivalent version

          icsdrone -handle RoboUser -password xxx -program crafty -sendLogin "seek 2 12 m\n set sendgameend seek 2 12 m" -proxy on

EXIT STATUS
       icsdroneng returns 1 ("restart") if the autoReconnect option is off and
       a network error occurs after a succesful login or a restart command is
       executed.  In all other cases a value > 1 is returned.
